scoring_instructions: |
  Each parameter should be scored from 0 to its maximum score based on the quality of execution.
  - Full Score: Complete, accurate, confident execution with clear evidence
  - Partial Score: Acceptable execution with minor gaps or issues
  - Zero Score: Missing, incorrect, or severely deficient execution
  - NA (Not Applicable): When a parameter is genuinely not applicable to the call context, mark it as NA and it receives FULL POINTS automatically
  - Evidence Required: Every score must be supported by specific transcript evidence with timestamps (except for NA)
  - No Assumptions: Score only what is explicitly present in the transcript
  
  NA Scoring Rules:
  - Mark a parameter as NA ONLY when it is genuinely not applicable to evaluate based on call context
  - NA automatically awards the maximum points for that parameter
  - Use NA sparingly and only when justified (e.g., no objections were raised, customer ended call abruptly)
  - To mark as NA, set score to -1 and explain why it's not applicable in the rationale

Includes: questions not answered, information gaps, being redirected to other teams, process concerns, frustration, skepticism, hesitation, site visit pushback, documentation questions, etc. Mark as NA only if customer showed ZERO concerns of ANY kind throughout entire call (extremely rare)"
